```

macOS Gatekeeper Bypass (2021 Edition) by Cedric Owens - macOS Catalina 10.15 (specifically tested on 10.15.7) and in macOS Big Sur before Big Sur 11.3 allows an attacker to very easily craft a macOS payload that is not checked by Gatekeeper. This can be used in phishing and all the victim has to do is double click to open the .dmg and double-click the fake app inside of the .dmg — no pop ups or warnings from macOS are generated.

##### Defense / Remediation: Update to Big Sur 11.3 or Catalina update 2021–002, where Apple has patched this bug.
