```
A logic issue was addressed with improved state management. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.3, Security Update 2021-002 Catalina. A malicious application may bypass Gatekeeper checks. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited..
```

macOS Gatekeeper Bypass (2021 Edition) by Cedric Owens - macOS Catalina 10.15 (specifically tested on 10.15.7) and in macOS Big Sur before Big Sur 11.3 allows an attacker to very easily craft a macOS payload that is not checked by Gatekeeper. This can be used in phishing and all the victim has to do is double click to open the .dmg and double-click the fake app inside of the .dmg — no pop ups or warnings from macOS are generated.

##### Defense / Remediation: Update to Big Sur 11.3 or Catalina update 2021–002, where Apple has patched this bug.

```
An integer overflow was addressed with improved input validation. This issue is fixed in Security Update 2021-005 Catalina, iOS 14.8 and iPadOS 14.8, macOS Big Sur 11.6, watchOS 7.6.2. Processing a maliciously crafted PDF may lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.

CVE-2021-30860 is an integer overflow in the CoreGraphics component, specifically the decoding of a JBIG2 data. JBIG2 (Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group) is an image compression format which can be embedded as a stream in a PDF or PSD document, or potentially other formats as well.

CoreGraphics.dylib. A vulnerable version of the .dylib (macOS 11.5.2) and a fixed version (in macOS 11.6) For analysis. Found under /System/Library/dyld/. Opening the dyld_shared_cache_x86_64 file in Hopper presents you with myriad of Frameworks to examine. Filter on the “CoreGraphics” one to open it up. Using Hopper to output the CoreGraphics.dylib to its own dedicated Mach-O file. To do this, we can use the “File->Produce New Executable” (or cmd+shift+e). diff these quickly, using IDA and BinDiff. 

An integer overflow is often paired with 1 or more other mistakes. For example, it is used in an allocation routine to allocate dynamic memory. That is exactly the case here.

##### Defense / Remediation: macOS versions prior to OSX Big Sur 11.6 affected; So update.
